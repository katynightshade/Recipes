    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sesame Chicken is a crispy, sweet and tangy chicken recipe often found in Chinese restaurants in the United States. Although the chicken is often deep fried to make it crispy, this recipe skips the breading to make it faster, easier and a little healthier.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5 pounds chicken thighs (boneless, skinless, cut into 1 inch pieces)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp canola oil</li>
        <li>2 tsp Sesame seeds</li>
        <li>1 bunch green onion</li>

        <li>4 garlic cloves minced</li>
        <li>1 tsp sriracha</li>
        <li>1 tbsp cornstarch</li>
