**Technologies Used**
-HTML

**Project Description**
This is the first project for _The Odin Project_'s Foundations course, meant to provide practice and display competency in HTML. 

**Reflection**
Because I had previous experience with HTML and CSS, this project did not provide many challenges for me. It did instill confidence that I can successfully use HTML on it's own. Many of the recipes are found from multiple online sources, which will be cited in the future.

**Reflection - 4/11/22**
This porject is complete aside from some small bugs that I intend to fix in the future. I understand the css memes in r/programmerhumor now. I also need for adjust a few things in my JavaScript in the future, including the way that sections return to their original position on the home screen. This is what I would consider to be my first "complete" project since learning front-end web development.

**Future Upgrades**
This project needs a lot of work to make it look better and provide interactivity. I'll use the HTML a bit more to add more recipes to the site and to cite the creators of the recipes. I plan to use CSS to create a mobile first design, making it responsive to the needs of the user, as well as creating a more attractive home page, specifically. I will also use JavaScript to create a "dinner spinner", where the user can choose a meat/no meat option and click a spinner and it will provide them a random recipe.
